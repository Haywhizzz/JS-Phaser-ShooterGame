> Final project in the Microverse JavaScript Curriculum

Implementation of a Space Shooter Game built with the [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) framework

## About The Project

The main objective of this project was to design and build a platform game. The basics of the game are used from the [Space Shooter Game](https://learn.yorkcs.com/category/tutorials/gamedev/phaser-3/build-a-space-shooter-with-phaser-3/) using Phaser and Javascript among other technologies.

## The game

The concept of game design is simple, as shown on screens. A jet in space shoots the bombs and collects coins to get scores. If the Jet collides with a bomb, the game is over. All assets are provided by code4cause.

### Characters

* Player: <div ><img src="assets/images/jet.png"></div>
It can move at 4 directions, and use the right click on the mouse to shoot enemies.

* Enemy: <div ><img src="assets/images/bomb.png"></div>
Bomb: It will appear randomly at random velocity. You receive +10 every time you make it explode.

* Collectible:  <div ><img src="assets/images/coin.png"></div>
Coin: It will appear at a random velocity. You will receive +5 points every time you collect one successfully
